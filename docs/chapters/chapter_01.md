## What is the ELIXIR Lesson Template?

The ELIXIR Lesson Template is a standardized framework designed to help educators create high-quality, consistent training materials for life sciences. It uses MkDocs, a static site generator, to produce user-friendly, web-based lessons.

Pros:

* Consistency: Ensures all lessons have a uniform structure, making them easier to follow and maintain.
* Accessibility: Web-based format allows learners to access materials from anywhere, anytime.
* Collaboration: Facilitates contributions from multiple authors, enhancing the quality and breadth of content.
* Customization: Offers flexibility to tailor lessons to specific needs while maintaining a core structure.
* Integration: Supports various plugins for enhanced functionality, such as video embedding and bibliography management

The ELIXIR Lesson template requires some familiarity with MkDocs and Markdown - but this course got you covered for these foundational skills and more!
